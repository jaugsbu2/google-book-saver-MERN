  # Google Book Saver - GraphQL

  ## Description

This is an application that allows users to create an account and save books they want to read to their account. The application was refactored to us Appolo Server and GraphQL queries/mutations in the place of the previous restful API calls. There are some inefficiencies within the application after doing the refactoring that could still improve its function. These are: When a book is saved, the user list of books should update and not allow the same book to be saved again. When a book is deleted, the saved books list component should be updated to render the removal of the deleted book. Currently the page refreshes (window.location.reload) to render these changes.
